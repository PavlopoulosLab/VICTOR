  <p><b>This tab visualizes the comparison between the clustering files as Sankey plots.</b></p>
  <p><b>Sankey Plot</b><br> The vertical rectangles represent the clustering files, which are connected with undirected bands. The height of a band is proportional to the similarity among selected clustering files. A slider allows the interactive adjustment of the selected metric's value. The higher the user-selected threshold, the fewer bands will be drawn.</p>
