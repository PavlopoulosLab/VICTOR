  <p><b>This tab allows the user to upload files containing clustering results. Once uploading has been completed, files can be renamed or removed. Any additional uploaded files are appended to the list. For selected files, basic statistics such as the number of clusters and objects are visualized as bar charts, whereas histograms show the object participation in the various clusters. Object filtering options are also available. </b></p>

  <p> <span class="blueText">1.</span> <span class="blackText">The <b>Upload Multiple clustering Files</b> option allows the user to upload clustering result files in text format. The file must consist of 2 columns without headers. Each object must belong to only one cluster (no duplicates allowed). The first column contains the cluster names, whereas the second column the cluster members in a comma-separated format. After the files have been uploaded, the user has the option to delete, rename and upload more files. </span></p>
  <p> <span class="blueText">2.</span><span class="blackText">The <b>Cluster Object Cutoff Range</b> option allows the user to filter clusters of selected filess, by applying minimum and maximum thresholds on the number of participating objects per cluster.</span> </p>
  <p> <span class="blueText">3.</span><span class="blackText">The third option allows the user to filter the clustering files by selecting either their object intersection or by creating singleton clusters for missing objects. This step is required when the selected clustering files for analysis (<b>Compare Clusterings</b>) do not contain exactly the same objects. The <b>Intersection</b> filtering option retains only objects that are common between all of the selected clustering files. On the other hand, for every object that is present in a clustering file but is missing from others, the <b>Superset</b> filtering option constructs a singleton cluster and assigns it to the latter.</span></p>

  <h2>Bar charts</h2>
  <p>Any selected raw or filtered files are visualized as bar charts. The upper part of the figures show the number of clusters per clustering file. The bottom bar plots show the total number of objects per clustering. On the left figure we observe that cluster 7 does not contain the same number of objects with the other files. After filtering the data with the <b>Superset</b> option, all clusterings contain exactly the same objects (right figure) and are ready to be analysed (<b>Compare Clusterings</b>).</p>

  <h2>Data</h2>
  <p>A selected clustering file in its raw or filtered version can be visualized as a table. The first column shows the cluster names, the second the cluster objects and the third the number of objects in each cluster. The user can download the clustering data in various formats.</p>
