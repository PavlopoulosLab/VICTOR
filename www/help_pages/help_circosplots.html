  <p><b>This tab visualizes the comparisons among clustering files as Circos plots.</b></p>
  <p><b>Circos Plot</b><br>In this tab, user-selected clustering files constitute the arcs of the circos plot and their similarities the ribbons that connect each other. Each clustering is represented by a different color, whereas the size of a ribbon is proportional to the similarity of between two clustering files. The higher the user-selected metric value threshold, the fewer ribbons will cover the Circos plot. </p>
