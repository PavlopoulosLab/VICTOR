  <p><b>This tab visualizes the comparison among clustering files as a bar plot.</b></p>
  <p><b>Bar plot</b><br>In this tab a bar plot is visualized for the selected metric. Each bar shows the pairwise comparisons of clustering files (A vs E, C vs F, etc) based on a user-selected metric, with the vertical axis displaying their similarity. Pairwise comparisons of the clustering files are represented in rectangles where the height of a rectangle is proportional to the value of the selected metric. A slider allows the interactive adjustment of the value range of the user-selected metric, which can be utilized to apply a cutoff threshold on the visualized bar plot.</p>
