  <p><b>This tab consists of two sub tabs: (i) Explore Interactive Network and (ii) Apply Layouts to Network. </b></p>
  <p><b>Interactive Network</b></p>
  <p>In this sub-tab, the data objects are represented as nodes and their pairwise values as edges. If no cutoff-threshold is selected then the drawn graph is fully connected. The higher the selected threshold, the sparser the graph. Similarly, the stronger the similarity the thicker the edge. Physics such as node charge, spring and gravity are enabled. </p>

  <p><b>Apply Layouts to Network</b></p>
  <p>In this sub-tab, the user can select among various layout algorithms. Here, physics are disabled, resulting in static network layouts.</p>
